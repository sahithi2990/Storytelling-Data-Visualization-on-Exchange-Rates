# Storytelling-Data-Visualization-on-Exchange-Rates
The goal of this project is to explore the evolution of the exchange rates between the following currencies:  EUR-USD, EUR-RUB (the Russian rouble). For each pair of currencies, we'll identify the main political and/or economical factors that influenced exchange rate dynamics during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Please refer to [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/sahithi2990/Storytelling-Data-Visualization-on-Exchange-Rates/blob/main/Storytelling%20Data%20Visualization%20on%20Exchange%20Rates.ipynb) for more information on this project.
